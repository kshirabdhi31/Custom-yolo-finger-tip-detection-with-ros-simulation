# Custom-yolo-finger-tip-detection-with-ros-simulation
A computer vision + robotics project that uses a custom-trained YOLOv5 model to detect a user's fingertip in real-time and simulate the drawing on a 2D TurtleBot in ROS. The system translates physical gestures into robot motion, creating a responsive finger-drawing simulator in a robotics environment.
