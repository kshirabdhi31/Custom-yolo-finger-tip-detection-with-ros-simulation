I have used yolov5 for my fingertip detection and trained my model on roboflow where my dataset was 1500 images including augmentation.70% train 15 % validate and 15% test.
Augmentation
90° Rotate:
Clockwise, Counter-Clockwise, Upside Down
Rotation:
Between -15° and +15°
Brightness:
Between -15% and +15%
I have included two videos of fingertip detection and a turtle recreating the movement of my fingertip in turtlesim.
Besttt.pt is the best dataset after running 200 epochs on my model.
